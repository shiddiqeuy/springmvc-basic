# springmvc-basic
What are we going to build?
A page displaying a list of fruits.

We will use our previous project project and add to it:
- a domain class: Fruits
- a model class (also called a service class): will generate a list of fruits
- a controller class: will get the fruit list from the service class.
- a view (JSP): will display the fruit list.
